# MiniTycoon
Test task in UE4 4.22

Added collecting resources from buildings by Left Clicking on them in Collect Mode, just because didn't want to leave overfilled buildings. 

Controls:
  E - to toggle Build and Collect mode
  Left Mouse Button - to Build or Collect resources
  WASD - to move camera
  Mouse Wheel - to zoom 

And there's a SettingsStruct in project's Content folder, which contains a few settings like Build Time, Build Cost and so on.
